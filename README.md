This repository contains a project focused on building a Movie Recommender System that suggests movies based on user preferences and historical data. The system leverages advanced recommendation algorithms to provide personalized and accurate suggestions.

Features:
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar to ones a user has liked, using metadata such as genre, director, actors, and plot keywords.
Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on the preferences and behavior of similar users.

Key Components:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing datasets, including movie metadata and user rating histories.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing trends like popular genres, highly rated movies, and user activity.
Model Development: Implementing recommendation algorithms such as matrix factorization, k-NN, and neural networks.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE, Precision@K, and Recall@K.

Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn, Surprise, TensorFlow/PyTorch for model development
Flask/Streamlit for building an interactive user interface
